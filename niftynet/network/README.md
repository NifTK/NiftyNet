# Developing a new network architecture
NiftyNet allows users create new network, and choose to use the network by
specifying command line argument.  To fully utilise this feature, a customised
network should be prepared in the following steps:

###### Step 1.
   Create a new network file, e.g., `my_network_collection/new_net.py` and make
   sure `my_network_collection` folder on the system `$PYTHONPATH`, these will
   ensure the network module (Python class) could be imported by the Python
   interpreter.

###### Step 2.
   Create a new class, e.g. `NewNet` in `new_net.py` by inheriting the
   `BaseNet` class from `niftynet.network.base_net`.  `niftynet.network.toynet`
   is a minimal working example of a fully convolutional network, can be a
   starting point for `NewNet`.

###### Step 3.
   In the `NewNet` class, implement `__init__()` function for network property
   initialisations, and implement `layer_op()` for network connections.

   The network properties can be used to specify the number of channels, kernel
   dilation factors, as well as sub-network components of the network.

   An example of sub-networks composition is presented in
   [Simulator Gan](./simulator_gan.py).

   The layer operation function `layer_op()` should specify how the input
   tensors are connected to network layers.  For basic building blocks, using
   the ones in `niftynet/layer/` are recommended. as the layers are implemented
   in a modular design (convenient for parameter sharing) and can handle 2D,
   2.5D and 3D cases in a unified manner whenever possible.

###### Step 4.
   Finally training the network could be done by specifying the newly
   implemented network in the command line argument `--name my_network_collection.new_net.NewNet`

   (`my_network_collection.new_net` refer to the `new_net.py` file, and `NewNet`
   is the class name with in `new_net.py`)

   e.g., training new network with segmentation application using pip installed NiftyNet:
   ```
   net_segment train -c /path/to/customised_config \
                     --name my_network_collection.new_net.NewNet
   ```
   or using NiftyNet cloned from [GitHub](https://github.com/NifTK/NiftyNet) or
   [CMICLab](https://cmiclab.cs.ucl.ac.uk/CMIC/NiftyNet):
   ```
   python net_segment.py train -c /path/to/customised_config \
                               --name my_network_collection.new_net.NewNet
   ```

###### Step 5.
   Please consider submitting the design to our model zoo.
