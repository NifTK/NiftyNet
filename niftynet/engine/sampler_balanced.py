"""
Generate image windows from a balanced sampling map as if every label
had the same probability of occurrence.

Consider a mask with three classes I, J, K with prevalence 0.1, 0.1, and
0.8, respectively. If 100 samples are drawn from the balanced sampler, the
classes should be approximately 33 I, 33 J, and 33 K.

This can also be considered a "balanced random cropping" layer of the
input image.

    This class generators samples from a user provided frequency map for each
    input volume. The sampling likelihood of each voxel is proportional its
    intra class frequency. That is, if a given voxel is of class `A` and there
    are 20 voxels with class `A`, the probability of selecting this voxel is
    5%. If there are 10 classes, the probability becomes 10% * 5% = 0.5%.

    In general, the likelihood of sampling a voxel is given by:
        p(v) = (1)/(# of unique labels * # of voxels with same class as v)

    This is done for balanced sampling. In the case of unbalanced labels,
    this sampler should produce a roughly equal probability of sampling each
    class.

    This layer can be considered as a "balanced random cropping" layer of the
