Welcome
=======
NiftyNet is a `TensorFlow`_-based open-source convolutional neural networks platform
for research in medical image analysis and image-guided therapy.
NiftyNet's modular structure is designed for sharing networks and pre-trained models.
NiftyNet is a consortium of research organisations
(BMEIS -- `School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King's College London`_;
WEISS -- `Wellcome EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences, UCL`_;
CMIC -- `Centre for Medical Image Computing, UCL`_;
HIG -- High-dimensional Imaging Group, UCL),
where BMEIS acts as the consortium lead.

Using NiftyNet's modular structure you can:

* Get started with established pre-trained networks using built-in tools
* Adapt existing networks to your imaging data
* Quickly build new solutions to your own image analysis problems


The code is available via `GitHub`_,
or you can quickly get started with the released versions in the
`Python Package Index`_.
You can also check out the `release notes`_.

.. _`GitHub`: https://github.com/NifTK/NiftyNet
.. _`Python Package Index`: https://pypi.org/project/NiftyNet/
.. _`release notes`: https://github.com/NifTK/NiftyNet/blob/dev/CHANGELOG.md


Quickstart
==========
This section shows you how to run a segmentation application with ``net_segment``
command, using a model with trained weights and image data downloaded
from `NiftyNet model zoo`_ with ``net_download``.

With NiftyNet `installed from PyPI`_:

.. code-block:: bash

    net_download dense_vnet_abdominal_ct_model_zoo
    net_segment inference -c ~/niftynet/extensions/dense_vnet_abdominal_ct/config.ini

With NiftyNet `source code`_ cloned at ``./NiftyNet/``:

.. code-block:: bash

    # go to the source code directory
    cd NiftyNet/
    python net_download.py dense_vnet_abdominal_ct_model_zoo
    python net_segment.py inference -c ~/niftynet/extensions/dense_vnet_abdominal_ct/config.ini

The segmentation output of this example application should be located at

.. code-block:: bash

    ~/niftynet/models/dense_vnet_abdominal_ct/segmentation_output/

.. topic:: Applications and models

  More applications and models are available at `NiftyNet model zoo`_ and the
  `network`_ directory.

.. topic:: Configuration specifications

  For detailed specifications of NiftyNet commands and configurations,
  check out our `Configuration docs`_.

.. topic:: Extending NiftyNet applications

  To learn more about developing NiftyNet applications, see the `Extending
  application`_ and `Developing new networks`_ section.
