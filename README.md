NiftyNet is a [TensorFlow][tf]-based open-source convolutional neural networks (CNN) platform for research in medical image analysis and image-guided therapy.
NiftyNet's modular structure is designed for sharing networks and pre-trained models.
Using this modular structure you can:

* Get started with established pre-trained networks using built-in tools
* Adapt existing networks to your imaging data
* Quickly build new solutions to your own image analysis problems

NiftyNet is a consortium of research groups (WEISS -- [Wellcome EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences][weiss], CMIC -- [Centre for Medical Image Computing][cmic], HIG -- High-dimensional Imaging Group), where WEISS acts as the consortium lead.


### Features

NiftyNet currently supports medical image segmentation and generative adversarial networks.
**NiftyNet is not intended for clinical use**.
Other features of NiftyNet include:

* Easy-to-customise interfaces of network components
* Sharing networks and pretrained models
* Support for 2-D, 2.5-D, 3-D, 4-D inputs*
* Efficient discriminative training with multiple-GPU support
* Implementation of recent networks (HighRes3DNet, 3D U-net, V-net, DeepMedic)
* Comprehensive evaluation metrics for medical image segmentation

 <sup>*2.5-D: volumetric images processed as a stack of 2D slices;
4-D: co-registered multi-modal 3D volumes</sup>

NiftyNet release notes are available [here][changelog].

[changelog]: CHANGELOG.md


### Installation

1. Please install the appropriate [TensorFlow][tf] package*:
   * [`pip install tensorflow-gpu==1.7`][tf-pypi-gpu] for TensorFlow with GPU support
   * [`pip install tensorflow==1.7`][tf-pypi] for CPU-only TensorFlow
1. [`pip install niftynet`](https://pypi.org/project/NiftyNet/)

 <sup>*All other NiftyNet dependencies are installed automatically as part of the pip installation process.
 
*To install from the source repository, please checkout [the instructions](http://niftynet.readthedocs.io/en/dev/installation.html).</sup>
